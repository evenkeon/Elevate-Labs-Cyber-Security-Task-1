
Step-by-Step Remediation Guide

Immediate Isolation

Disconnect 192.168.0.114 from the network to stop further exploitation.

Block Unnecessary Ports via Firewall

Deny inbound access to ports: 21, 23, 25, 53, 80, 111, 139, 445, 512–514, 1524, 2049, 2121, 3306, 5432, 5900, 6000, 6667, 8009, 8180.
Example (UFW):
sudo ufw deny 21
sudo ufw deny 23
…
sudo ufw reload

Service Decommission or Patch

Replace vsftpd 2.3.4, OpenSSH 4.7p1, Samba 3.0.20, MySQL 5.0.51a, PostgreSQL 8.3 with supported, patched versions.

Disable Telnet, rshd, rexecd, anonymous FTP.

Credential Hardening

Enforce SSH key-based authentication only; disable root login.

Set strong, unique passwords for all remaining services.

Remove default or sample accounts.

Network Segmentation

Place critical servers in isolated VLANs.

Allow management access only via VPN or dedicated subnet.

Enable Logging and Monitoring

Deploy IDS/IPS to detect scan and exploit attempts.

Configure centralized logging for all hosts and services.

Regular Vulnerability Scanning

Schedule weekly Nmap scans and quarterly full vulnerability assessments.

Review and remediate new findings promptly.

Patch Management Process

Establish automated patch deployment for OS and applications.

Test patches in staging before production rollout.

Incident Response Planning

Develop playbooks for isolation, forensics, and recovery.

Conduct tabletop exercises with the security team.

User Awareness and Training

Educate administrators on secure configurations and monitoring.

Enforce least-privilege access controls.

By executing these steps, the network’s attack surface will be minimized, critical vulnerabilities remediated, and monitoring in place to detect future threats.
